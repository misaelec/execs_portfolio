            <p class="cases-paragraph-inside-title">McDonald's is a global fast-food chain known for its iconic burgers, fries, and other delicious menu items. With locations worldwide, McDonald's offers convenient and affordable meal options for people on the go.</p>
            <p class="cases-paragraph-inside">I designed a WhatsApp chatbot to streamline the ordering process and offer exclusive discounts to McDonald's customers. The project was initially planned for a one-month completion, but with meticulous planning and efficient execution, we successfully delivered the chatbot within one month and one week. This work would take us usually 2 months at least.
              The chatbot offered a convenient and interactive way for customers to browse the menu, place orders, and receive personalized discount coupons. To ensure a seamless experience, I crafted the chatbot's dialogue, incorporating natural language processing and intuitive prompts.
              Once the chatbot was developed, it was successfully launched in Mexico and later expanded to Colombia, with the content localized to cater to the specific preferences and language of each market. The chatbot's successful implementation demonstrated the power of innovative technology in enhancing the customer experience and driving sales.</p>
